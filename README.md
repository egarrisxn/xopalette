## **Before You Begin**

This app uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the default package manager for faster dependency resolution and disk space efficiency. However, you can switch to `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` if preferred.

### Updataing Package Manager

By default, this app enforces `pnpm`. To use another package manager, follow these steps:

#### 1. Remove `pnpm` Enforcement

Open `package.json` and modify or remove the following lines:

```json
"preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm",
"prebuild": "pnpm run lint"
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies Using Your Preferred Manager

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install  # or yarn install, bun install
```

Now you're ready to start building! 🚀

## **Getting Started**

#### 1. Clone the App

First, clone the repository onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egarrisxn/xopalette.git xopalette
cd xopalette
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Start the Development Server

Launch the local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### 4. Open in Your Browser

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file. Now, get to building! 🚀

## **Deployment**

For a seamless deployment experience, use the **Deploy** button below to launch your project on Vercel.

Note: You are not limited to Vercel and may deploy this app on any platform that supports Next.js. However, in my experience, Vercel provides the fastest and most convenient setup.
